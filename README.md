# Python Discovery Practice and Examples


_This Repository stores much of my work from a "Python 2" course during my time at the University at Colorado Boulder. This class was the second
iteration in a 3-course curriculum and served to build on the basic loops, data types, and functions learned during the first iteration.
The majority of executable files here were done in Jupyter Notebooks through the Anaconda IDE, with a smaller number of them completed with the
use of Google Colab. This work is being posted as an example of the exposure I have had to various aspects of Python and is meant to showcase
a small amount of my applicable training with data manipulation_



The files contained within this repository include four data sources, two of the .txt variety and two of .csv, that were used to complete various
forms of analysis using Python. The data touches on topics including beatles lyrics, sports data (baseball), and Rolling Stones albums. Through
my analysis, I touched on lists, dictionaries, nested structures, APIs, Classes/Object Oriented Programming, Strings, REGEX, PANDAS, and NUMPY.
The course was developed using a mixture of these tools to manipulate and provide actionable insight into the information stored in large data files.
Beyond the scope of this class, many of the tools I learned here have been used in personal projects of mine also stored within my github. I found
the class to be comprehensive and well-rounded in its contents and many of the files within this repository are the foundation to my success as a 
programmer, specifically within the data analytics and manipulation space.

Features
* Diverse Data Sources: I utilized four different data sources, including .txt and .csv files, covering topics such as Beatles lyrics, baseball sports data, and Rolling Stones albums. These datasets were used to perform various forms of analysis and manipulation.
* Comprehensive Toolset: The course curriculum incorporated a range of tools and techniques to manipulate and analyze data, providing actionable insights from large datasets. The files within this repository serve as a foundation for my proficiency in data analytics and manipulation.
* Real-world Applications: Many of the tools and techniques learned in this course have been applied to personal projects stored within my GitHub repository. The practical skills acquired here have contributed significantly to my success as a programmer, particularly in the realm of data analytics.

Conclusion
This repository represents my journey through the Python 2 course at the University of Colorado Boulder and showcases my proficiency in Python programming and data manipulation. From analyzing Beatles lyrics to delving into sports data and Rolling Stones albums, I've demonstrated my ability to apply Python tools and techniques to diverse datasets.
